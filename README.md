# EntynetProject - Quack

This is a reupload of the github repository originally created by the Entynet Project.
The repository has since disappeared, so if anybody wants to use quack but can't find a copy, here it is

The program itself (most recently tested on the 9th of November 2020) is still completely functional


You may have to install the script manually (check + install dependencies below, and manually chmod +x + move script to /usr/bin)

# Dependencies (Drawn from original install.sh script)

* git
* python3
* python3-pip

# Python3 requirements (Drawn from original requirements.txt list)
* phonenumbers
* requests
* scapy
* wget
* argparse


If you need help installing this program, submit an issue and I'm more than happy to help
